Hello everyone! 🌟
I recently worked on a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline setup from scratch, designed specifically for beginners who want hands-on experience in automation and deployment. This project walks through setting up Jenkins on AWS EC2, integrating GitHub for version control, and deploying a web application on Tomcat using Maven.
🔹𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐂𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬:
✅ Setting up Jenkins on AWS EC2
✅ Installing & Configuring Tomcat
✅ GitHub Integration with Jenkins
✅ Automating WAR Deployment
✅ Enabling Continuous Deployment with GitHub 
🎯 𝐖𝐡𝐨 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫?
If you’re a beginner in Jenkins & DevOps, this project will help you understand the core concepts of CI/CD with a real-world implementation.
